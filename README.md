# A work day scheduler created using JavaScript, CSS & HTML

This is a simple work day scheduler that displays the hours of 9 AM to 5 PM and can be modified to add or delete tasks throughout the day.

## Description 

This is my first attempt at making a scheduler and I wrote the HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the help of my Discord study group. To use the scheduler, simply click on the text box between the time and the save button and type in a task or something to accomplish and click the save button. You will be able to leave or refresh the page and the saved elements will remain there. The current hour is displayed in red, the future hours are displayed in green and past hours of the day are grey. Note: To delete a task, simply click on something you have typed between the time and save button, delete it and click save again. 

(This was a homework assignment that I took on to challenge myself as I am learning to code. Through this assignment, I have furthered my understanding of JavaScript, CSS, HTML and learning how to code in general.)
